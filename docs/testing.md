# Testing

`tests/FootballFormation.Core.Tests` — xUnit v3. Run with `dotnet test` from the repo root.

CI runs `dotnet build -c Release` and `dotnet test` as a **gate**: the Fly.io deploy job depends on
it, so nothing reaches the production volume that doesn't compile and pass. Before that gate
existed a push to `main` deployed straight to production, and the app auto-migrates on boot — a bad
migration reached a live database on startup.

## What is covered

Every test class, so a gap here is visible rather than assumed:

| Area | File | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Game`, `Season`, `SeasonSquad` | `GameTests`, `SeasonTests`, `SeasonSquadTests` | The domain rules — season windows, the roster rule, the clock arithmetic |
| Date ordering | `GameOrderingTests`, `SeasonOrderingTests` | Pins the rule that dates are sorted after materialising, never in SQL |
| Formation slots | `FormationSlotsTests` | Every pitch draws from this; a bug lays lineups out wrong |
| Formations | `FormationTypeTests` | Each shape must field exactly ten outfield players |
| Report builders | `GameMinutesReportTests`, `PlayerStatsReportTests`, `SeasonStatsReportTests`, `PlayingTimeReportTests`, `PlannedChangesReportTests`, `MatchClockReportTests` | Minutes and statistics — wrong answers here are invisible until a season is over |
| Position fit | `PositionFitHelperTests` | The five tiers that colour every chip |
| Live match | `LiveMatchServiceTests` | Clock banking, period transitions, substitution undo |
| Games and comments | `GameServiceTests`, `GameCommentTests` | Season derivation on create, scalar-only update, and the public/private split |
| Seasons and squads | `SeasonServiceTests`, `SeasonSquadServiceTests` | Gapless windows, the single current season, copy-forward and the removal guards |
| Match preferences | `MatchPreferencesServiceTests` | Per-season inheritance, and next-match dates staying inside the window |
| **Authorization** | `AuthorizationTests` | That every write refuses a non-admin *at the service*, not only in the markup — the guard the whole write path rests on |
| Accounts | `UserServiceTests`, `SeededAdminTests` | Credentials, security stamps, the last-admin guard, and the seeded account being no working login |
| Boot safety | `DatabaseSafetyTests`, `HealthReportTests` | The pre-migration snapshot and what `/health` is allowed to call healthy |
| Service lifetime | `ServiceLifetimeTests` | Concurrent reads, and detached entities round-tripping through update |
| `Result` | `ResultTests` | Error keys, arguments, and the guard on reading a failed value |

## Conventions

- **Test names are sentences.** `A_match_in_progress_is_never_complete_however_many_goals_are_logged`
  says what the rule is; a failure names the rule that broke.
- **Real SQLite, not the in-memory provider.** `ServiceTestBase` opens a `Filename=:memory:`
  connection and keeps it open for the test. The services lean on foreign keys, unique indexes,
  cascade behaviour and the CSV value converters — the in-memory provider enforces none of that, so
  a test passing there can still fail against the database the app ships with.
- **Services are constructed in `ServiceTestBase`,** not in each test class, so the wiring lives in
  one place.
- **Every query the suite makes is watched for a date comparison in SQL.**
  `ServiceTestBase` registers `DateInSqlInterceptor` on the context factory, so any query that
  sorts or compares one of the schema's TEXT date columns in SQL throws
  `DateComparedInSqlException` naming the column — whichever test happened to run it. The rule it
  enforces is in [known_issues.md](known_issues.md); the short version is materialise first, then
  order the objects with `GameOrdering` / `SeasonOrdering`.
  The columns come from the EF model rather than a hand-kept list, so a new `DateTime` property is
  covered as soon as it is mapped. A query that genuinely has to compare in SQL opts out with
  `.TagWith(QueryTags.ComparesDatesInSql)` — one does, and `DateInSqlGuardTests` pins both the
  refusal and the exemption.
- **Time is injected.** `FakeTimeProvider` drives the match clock, so
  `Time.Advance(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(7))` is a seven-minute half rather than a sleep. Never use
  `DateTime.UtcNow` in a service — take `TimeProvider`.
- **Arrange with `TestData`.** A game is a four-level graph (game → periods → lineups → players);
  building one inline buries the single fact the test is about.
- **Comment the why, not the what.** A test that pins down a subtle rule should say what would
  break without it.

## Adding a test

Domain logic on a model or in `Core/Reporting` needs no fixture — it is a pure function. For
anything touching the database, inherit `ServiceTestBase` and use the service properties it
exposes; `Db` is for arranging and asserting, and `Read()` gives a fresh context for reading back
what a service wrote without tracking interference.

## What is not covered

No component tests — no bUnit. Razor markup and interaction are verified in a browser instead; see
the `verify-ui` skill for the desktop/mobile × anonymous/admin matrix, and the visual check below
for the automated pass.

## Visual checks

`scripts/visual-check.sh` boots the app and screenshots every page into `artifacts/visual/`
(ignored by git). It builds, starts the app on a **throwaway database** in a temp directory, signs
in, seeds a small squad through the real dialogs, and captures each page at 1440×900. It exits
non-zero if the browser logged an error, which is where a Blazor render failure shows up.

Two things it has to work around, both of them the app behaving correctly:

- A fresh admin still holds the password it was seeded with, and that **locks every route to
  `/settings`** until it changes. Without that step every screenshot is the same page.
- Changing a password **rotates the security stamp**, which invalidates the cookie issued before
  it. The script signs in again afterwards, or it would browse as an anonymous visitor.

It signs in through `/dev/login` — mapped only outside Production and only for loopback callers —
so no password is typed into the login form.

## Running it in Claude Code on the web

Those containers are rebuilt per session and ship no .NET SDK, so without setup an agent can read
the code but cannot compile it, run the tests, or open a page. `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`
installs it on session start.

It takes the SDK from **Ubuntu 24.04's own archive** (`dotnet-sdk-10.0` in `noble-updates/main`),
not from `dotnet-install.sh` — the container's egress policy blocks
`builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`, so the usual installer 403s before it downloads anything.
`api.nuget.org` is reachable, so `dotnet restore` works normally.

Chromium is already in the image at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`; `scripts/visual-check.sh`
installs the Playwright npm package on first use and drives that binary rather than downloading
its own.
