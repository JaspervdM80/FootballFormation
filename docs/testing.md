# Testing

`tests/FootballFormation.Core.Tests` — xUnit v3. Run with `dotnet test` from the repo root.

CI runs `dotnet build -c Release` and `dotnet test` as a **gate**: the Fly.io deploy job depends on
it, so nothing reaches the production volume that doesn't compile and pass. Before that gate
existed a push to `main` deployed straight to production, and the app auto-migrates on boot — a bad
migration reached a live database on startup.

## What is covered

| Area | File | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Game`, `Season`, `SeasonSquad` | `GameTests`, `SeasonTests`, `SeasonSquadTests` | The domain rules — season windows, the roster rule, the clock arithmetic |
| Formation slots | `FormationSlotsTests` | Every pitch draws from this; a bug lays lineups out wrong |
| Formations | `FormationTypeTests` | Each shape must field exactly ten outfield players |
| Report builders | `GameMinutesReportTests`, `PlayerStatsReportTests`, `SeasonStatsReportTests`, `PlayingTimeReportTests` | Minutes and statistics — wrong answers here are invisible until a season is over |
| Position fit | `PositionFitHelperTests` | The five tiers that colour every chip |
| Live match | `LiveMatchServiceTests` | Clock banking, period transitions, substitution undo |
| Service lifetime | `ServiceLifetimeTests` | Concurrent reads, and detached entities round-tripping through update |
| `Result` | `ResultTests` | Error keys, arguments, and the guard on reading a failed value |

## Conventions

- **Test names are sentences.** `A_match_in_progress_is_never_complete_however_many_goals_are_logged`
  says what the rule is; a failure names the rule that broke.
- **Real SQLite, not the in-memory provider.** `ServiceTestBase` opens a `Filename=:memory:`
  connection and keeps it open for the test. The services lean on foreign keys, unique indexes,
  cascade behaviour and the CSV value converters — the in-memory provider enforces none of that, so
  a test passing there can still fail against the database the app ships with.
- **Services are constructed in `ServiceTestBase`,** not in each test class, so the wiring lives in
  one place.
- **Time is injected.** `FakeTimeProvider` drives the match clock, so
  `Time.Advance(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(7))` is a seven-minute half rather than a sleep. Never use
  `DateTime.UtcNow` in a service — take `TimeProvider`.
- **Arrange with `TestData`.** A game is a four-level graph (game → periods → lineups → players);
  building one inline buries the single fact the test is about.
- **Comment the why, not the what.** A test that pins down a subtle rule should say what would
  break without it.

## Adding a test

Domain logic on a model or in `Core/Reporting` needs no fixture — it is a pure function. For
anything touching the database, inherit `ServiceTestBase` and use the service properties it
exposes; `Db` is for arranging and asserting, and `Read()` gives a fresh context for reading back
what a service wrote without tracking interference.

## What is not covered

No component tests — no bUnit. Razor markup and interaction are verified in a browser instead; see
the `verify-ui` skill for the desktop/mobile × anonymous/admin matrix.
